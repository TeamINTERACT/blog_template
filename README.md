# Blog Template

The purpose of an INTERACT data science blog post is to provide a reproducible example and explanation of an advanced method used for INTERACT papers. You can see the full template and getting started page [here]() with `.Rmd` file available [here]().  There are lots of existing tutorials for very basic tasks like simple ML problems or making maps. What we want to do is get deeper with the tutorials and methods. 

[stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) describes a minimal, reproducible example as a the following:  

- __Minimal:__ Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem
- __Complete:__ Provide all parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem in the question itself
- __Reproducible:__ Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem

The basic idea is as follows:  

1. Show the data 
2. Provide all of the code to produce the results 
3. Provide interpretive discussion of the output at each step
